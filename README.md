# Custom-Skill-Cap
[Introducing - Custom Skill Cap]
Have you ever been playing MGT2 and thought to yourself:
I want to create a more skilled and beloved character.
I'm tired of resorting to sheer numbers for battles; besides, it's putting a strain on my PC!
I crave some endgame content! Hitting level 100 just doesn't cut it anymore!
Well, look no further! Allow me to introduce Custom Skill Cap!

By incorporating this mod, you can achieve the following:
Adjust the maximum values for major skills related to your profession.
Adjust the maximum values for minor skills unrelated to your profession.
Adjust the maximum values for Talent Perk's minor skills.
Say goodbye to the level caps at 100, 60, or 50!
As part of the endgame content, you have the flexibility to set the level cap at a staggering 9999.
You can also align minor skill caps with major skills. This mod expands your freedom within MGT2 gameplay.
Furthermore, as your character levels up, the skill points you gain during character creation will significantly increase.

Enjoy the enhanced experience!
